# Hello, World!

- **This is about the Cyber Odyssey CTF 2024 competition**

I had such a blast at the competition! The challenges from the organizers were amazing, and I loved every bit of it! ðŸ¥³

I was so happy to contribute by solving other categories like forensics and misc. it was a proud moment for sure. Honestly, I wish I could relive this experience every week because it was *that* good hhh! A massive thank you to the organizers for making this event happen. I canâ€™t wait to see more of these in the future. ðŸ’• 

Shoutout to my awesome team for being incredible! Big love to **whydude230** for absolutely nailing the crypto category and helping with other challenges, and of course to **pip the blooder** for dominating the pwn challenges like a boss while supporting us in everything else. And, well, letâ€™s not forget the true web legendâ€”yours trulyâ€”handling the web challenges like a champ. ðŸ˜‚âœ¨

And last but definitely not least, thank you **Saad** for being our all-rounder hero, helping in every category and solving challenges left and right. You're the MVP! ðŸ™Œ

Oh, and a special mention to all the other teams who shared knowledge and made this event even more fun especially **n0b4r4**'s team. You guys are awesome! ðŸŽ‰
