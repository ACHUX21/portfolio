# Hello!

- **About the 0x01 CTF 2024 competition**

I had the honor of being part of the organizing team for the 0x01 CTF 2024 competition! A big thanks to **N0b4r4** for this opportunity.

I was thrilled to contribute by creating challenges for the competition. It was a proud moment and an incredible experience. Watching the teams solve and struggle with the challenges was truly enjoyable 😂.

I crafted some exciting web challenges, or so I was told 😄. I hope you enjoyed them as much as I did while making them.

I also enjoyed exploring the university campus. It was a beautiful place, and I had a wonderful time, even though I didn't uncover all its hidden mysteries, but I'll save that for next time 😁.

You can find the write-ups for the challenges [here](https://blog.achux.me/posts/bc3686ec/).

I want to thank all the organizers for their kindness. It was a pleasure working with you all.

As I write this post, I'm preparing for the next competition (Cyber Odyssey CTF 2024) and I can't wait to see what the future holds. Until next time! 🚀
