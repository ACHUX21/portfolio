Let me tell you about something truly incredible... **L3akCTF 2024** our very first **Capture the Flag** competition, organized by **Team L3ak**! And oh boy, what a journey it was. It was a whirlwind of excitement, hard work, and a whole lot of fun!  

The event kicked off on **May 24, 2024**, and we had **48 hours** of nonstop action. Teams and individuals from all over the world joined us to tackle some seriously challenging cybersecurity problems. The best part? The competition was **Jeopardy-style**, meaning we had a bunch of categories like **Crypto**, **Web**, **Rev**, **Pwn**, **Forensics**, **OSINT**, **Hardware**, and **Misc**. Each one was a new adventure, and let me tell you, it kept everyone on their toes! 🎯  

Now, let’s talk about the winners because they absolutely earned it! 🏆  
- **1st Place**: **KCSC**  
- **2nd Place**: **MadrHacks**  
- **3rd Place**: **Srdnlen**  

Congrats to these amazing teams who really brought their A-game! You guys are incredible. 🎉  

As an organizer, I was so proud of how the event turned out. From the challenges to the amazing community of participants, everything came together beautifully. Huge thanks to our sponsors, **Zellic**, **OtterSec**, and **StackIt**, for supporting us and helping make this event a reality! 🙏  

What made it even more exciting was that the **future weight** of the event was up for public voting, and it’s sitting at **24.43**—could this be the start of something even bigger? I can't wait to see what happens next year! 🌟

If you missed out this time, don’t worry, because this was just the first edition, and I can already feel the energy building for the next one. 😎  

A big thank you to everyone who participated, shared tips, and made this CTF unforgettable. Can’t wait to see all of you in the next challenge! 🚀

Until then, stay awesome, and keep hacking! 🔥
